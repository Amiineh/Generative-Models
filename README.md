# Generative-Models
In this project two deep generative models ([VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), [GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)) and their conditional forms ([CVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08568), [CGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)) have been implemented on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. 

You can see some of the results in the results folder.
